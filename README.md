# Power-BI-condensed-dynamic-performance-report
The objective of this project was to design and develop a condensed, dynamic performance report using Power BI. The report enables users to interactively view key performance indicators (KPIs) across various dimensions with visual clarity and flexibility. This Power BI project involved creating an interactive and user-friendly dashboard that consolidates multiple performance metrics into a single, streamlined view. The report allows users to switch between different KPIs dynamically and visually highlight key insights through conditional formatting.
