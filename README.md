# Power-BI-condensed-dynamic-performance-report
The objective of this project was to design and develop a condensed, dynamic performance report using Power BI to enable users to interactively view key performance indicators (KPIs) across various dimensions with visual clarity and flexibility. I created an interactive and user-friendly dashboard that consolidates multiple performance metrics into a single streamlined view, allowing users to switch between different KPIs dynamics and visually highlight key insights through conditional formatting.
